        <h3>
          1. What is Database and DBMS? List out the advantages and
          disadvantages of DBMS.
        </h3>
        <p>
          A database is a structured collection of data that allows for
          efficient retrieval, management, and storage. It is designed to
          organize data in such a way that it can be easily accessed, managed,
          and updated. A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system
          that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to
          the database. DBMS acts as an interface between the end user and the
          database, managing data, the database engine, and the database schema
          to facilitate the organization and manipulation of data.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Advantages of DBMS:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Reduces data redundancy through normalization and central
            management.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improves data integrity and accuracy by enforcing constraints.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allows multiple users to access data simultaneously without
            conflict.
          </li>
          <li>Provides security features to protect sensitive data.</li>
          <li>Backup and recovery features to prevent data loss.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Disadvantages of DBMS:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>High initial cost for setup and maintenance.</li>
          <li>Complexity in installation and management.</li>
          <li>
            May require additional hardware resources and specialized personnel.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          2. Differentiate between file processing system and DBMS. Give at
          least four points.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Redundancy:</strong> File processing systems store
            duplicate data across multiple files. DBMS reduces redundancy by
            centralizing data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Consistency:</strong> Data inconsistencies are common
            in file systems. DBMS ensures consistency with rules and
            relationships.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Access:</strong> File systems use custom programs. DBMS
            allows data access using queries (e.g., SQL).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security:</strong> File systems lack built-in security. DBMS
            provides granular control over data access.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          3. Explain the different models of DBMS with advantages and
          disadvantages.
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Hierarchical Model:</strong> Data is organized in a tree
          structure. Each child has one parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple and easy to design. Efficient for
          fixed relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Complex relationships are difficult.
          Data redundancy may occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Network Model:</strong> Uses graph structures with multiple
          relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages:</strong> Allows complex relationships. Faster
          access.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> More complex. Difficult to manage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Relational Model:</strong> Organizes data into tables with
          rows and columns.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple structure. Easy querying with SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Joins may reduce performance. Limited
          in handling complex data types.
        </p>

        <h3>
          4. What is a relational database? How is it different from other
          database models?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A relational database organizes data into tables (relations)
          consisting of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). Each table
          represents one entity type, and relationships are established using
          keys. Unlike hierarchical or network models, it uses structured
          queries and enforces rules through constraints and normalization.
        </p>

        <h3>5. What is data redundancy? How does DBMS help in reducing it?</h3>
        <p>
          Data redundancy refers to unnecessary repetition of data. It leads to
          wastage of storage and data inconsistency. DBMS reduces redundancy
          using normalization, centralized storage, and relational integrity
          which avoid storing the same data at multiple locations.
        </p>

        <h3>
          6. Differentiate between centralized and distributed database systems.
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Centralized Database:</strong> Stored at a single location.
          Easy to manage but prone to failure and slower remote access.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Distributed Database:</strong> Data is stored across multiple
          locations. More reliable and scalable, but complex to manage and
          secure.
        </p>

        <h3>
          7. Who is Database Administrator (DBA)? What are the major
          responsibilities of DBA?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A Database Administrator (DBA) manages the database system to ensure
          data availability, integrity, and security. Responsibilities include
          installation, configuration, backup, recovery, performance tuning,
          security management, and ensuring compliance with policies.
        </p>

        <h3>
          8. Define normalization. Explain 1NF, 2NF and 3NF with suitable
          examples.
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Normalization</strong> is a process to structure a relational
          database to reduce redundancy and improve integrity. It involves
          dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1NF:</strong> Atomic values. E.g., a table should not have
          multiple phone numbers in one column.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2NF:</strong> No partial dependency on primary key. Applies
          when table has a composite key.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3NF:</strong> No transitive dependency. Non-key attributes
          should not depend on other non-key attributes.
        </p>

        <h3>
          9. Explain the terms: primary key, foreign key, and candidate key with
          examples.
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Primary Key:</strong> A unique identifier for each record.
          E.g., StudentID in Students table.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Foreign Key:</strong> A field that refers to the primary key
          in another table. E.g., ClassID in Students referring to Classes
          table.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Candidate Key:</strong> Any attribute that can uniquely
          identify records. E.g., both Email and StudentID if they’re unique.
        </p>

        <h3>10. What is SQL? Explain its components and common functions.</h3>
        <p>
          Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to communicate with databases.
          Its components include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>DDL:</strong> CREATE, ALTER, DROP</li>
          <li><strong>DML:</strong> SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE</li>
          <li><strong>DCL:</strong> GRANT, REVOKE</li>
          <li><strong>TCL:</strong> COMMIT, ROLLBACK</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN()</p>

        <h3>11. Write SQL commands to perform the following operations:</h3>
        <pre>
CREATE TABLE Students (
  Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Class VARCHAR(20),
  Marks INT
);

INSERT INTO Students VALUES (1, 'Anita', '10A', 78);
INSERT INTO Students VALUES (2, 'Sita', '10A', 82);
INSERT INTO Students VALUES (3, 'Ram', '10B', 76);

SELECT * FROM Students;

UPDATE Students SET Marks = 85 WHERE Name = 'Anita';

DELETE FROM Students WHERE Id = 3;
      </pre
